Best for us to assess your abilities is build of a boilerplate

Node/Express/Mongo. It is a realistic scenario where of course OS is at your disposal and 
shows your abilities for seeing the big picture

So what is this going to be assessed on? What counts is how you work out a fitting structure that keeps in mind: 
production ready and of scale 20xCRUD

Considerations: microservices, scalability (load). A validation model should be there and think about organization of modules

Needless to say that everyone has a boilerplate he/she already uses to create

Still, taking it serious is advised since this alone will serve as a comparison to other candidates and determine shortlist or not

It is a 48 hour submission so 16:00 IST Monday
